# WASM Transformer LLM


## Overview
The WASM Transformer LLM is a powerful, lightweight language model designed to be run in WebAssembly (WASM) environments. This project aims to leverage the efficiency and portability of WASM to bring advanced NLP capabilities directly to web browsers, edge devices, and other environments where traditional models may be too resource-intensive.

**Key Features**
1. WebAssembly Compatibility: The model is optimized for running in WASM, ensuring it can be deployed across a wide range of platforms, from browsers to IoT devices, without compromising performance.
2. Lightweight and Efficient: Designed with efficiency in mind, this transformer model strikes a balance between performance and resource usage, making it ideal for low-latency applications.
3. Customizable and Extensible: The model architecture is built to be easily extensible, allowing developers to fine-tune and adapt it to specific use cases with minimal effort.
4. Support for NLP Tasks: The WASM Transformer LLM is capable of handling a variety of NLP tasks, including text generation, summarization, translation, and more.
